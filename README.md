### DailyWiki

Read a little more about this app on my website - http://epbarger.github.io/ruby/2016/04/24/dailywiki.html.

Currently hosted at https://daily-wiki.herokuapp.com/.

Extremely basic Sinatra app. Requires a redis connection, but otherwise does not use a database. 

The basic concept is to fetch a fresh list of random wikipedia articles every 24 hours. I tend to find myself lost in Wikipedia often, so this is a little way to jump-start that adventure each day :)
